space-jazz
==========

A space invaders clone written in Java without any external libraries. This is a school projects that focuses to make everything as object oriented as possible. It uses Swing for drawing and a proper gameloop without any framerate caps. Since we were fairly familiar with Microsoft's XNA before starting this project, many aspects of this project may look really close to XNA.

##Folders
```
space-jazz                              Main project workspace
space-jazz\src                          Source code
space-jazz\content                      Game content like graphics or sound
space-jazz\content\content-source\      Project files from Gimp, Photoshop (graphcics) and Famitracker (sound)
```

##Compiling
If you want to compile and run this game (using Eclipse), clone it and set your Eclipse workspace to the first space-jazz folder (the one next to READNME.md). You may need to import the project using File -> Import -> Java Project. 

Note: we are using hardcoded "\" as directory separators which means that the game may have problems loading content on non-Windows systems. This will be fixed in the future.
